# Jython Parser Project

This project is a Jython parser built using ANTLR in Java. This tool is  designed to compile and check the semantic errors of Jython code. The parser reads Jython source code from an input file, generates a parse tree, and walks through it using a custom listener. The project demonstrates how to tokenize, parse, and analyze Jython code using ANTLR's lexer and parser functionalities. We developed this project as a part of the Compiler Design course.

## Project Structure
- **Lexer**: `JythonLexer` is generated by ANTLR and is responsible for breaking the input into tokens.
- **Parser**: `JythonParser` is also generated by ANTLR and is used to create the parse tree from the tokenized input.
- **Listener**: `JythonListener` is an interface generated by ANTLR, which you can implement to traverse and process the parse tree.
- **Compiler Class**: `JythonCompiler` is the main entry point for the project, responsible for initiating the parsing process and walking the parse tree with a custom listener (`MyJythonListener`).

## How to Run
1. **ANTLR Setup**: Ensure ANTLR is set up in your project to generate the lexer, parser, and listener from your Jython grammar.
2. **Input File**: Place your Jython code in `input.txt` for parsing.
3. **Compile and Run**: Use a Java IDE or command-line tools to compile and run `JythonCompiler.java`.

## Tech Stack
- **ANTLR**: Used for generating the lexer, parser, and listener from the Jython grammar.
- **Java**: The programming language for implementing the parser and compiler.
- **Jython**: A Python-like language used as the source code input.
